* Apply both modules (5 min EMR + 15 min MSK)
terraform apply -target=module.emr -target=module.msk

* Get new connection info (will be different)
terraform output msk_connection_info
terraform output emr_master_dns


* Update data_generator.py with new Kafka servers
* Update any other scripts with new connection details

aws s3 cp data_generator.py s3://spark-kafka-pipeline-zn1fp2wf/scripts/
* (S3 bucket persists, scripts stay there)

* Continue with Data Enrichment stage


Tomorrow's restart will be:

terraform apply -target=module.emr -target=module.msk
Get new connection info
Continue with Data Enrichment stage

For Your New Chat ðŸ’¬
Mention:

âœ… EMR + MSK infrastructure working
âœ… Data Generator successfully sending to Kafka
âœ… S3 dimension data ready
ðŸŽ¯ Next: Data Enrichment stage (sensors-sample â†’ samples-enriched)

You've successfully completed the hardest part - infrastructure + data generation!
The enrichment stage will be much smoother since you understand EMR Steps now! ðŸš€

Input/Output:

Input: sensors-sample Kafka topic (your JSON events)
Output: samples-enriched Kafka topic (enriched JSON)

What it does:

Reads sensor events from Kafka
Joins with your S3 dimension tables (car_models, car_colors, cars)
Adds: brand_name, model_name, color_name, driver_id
Calculates: expected_gear = round(speed/30)
Outputs enriched JSON to new topic


**What I need for next chat:**

Updated Kafka servers (will be different tomorrow)
New EMR cluster ID (for step submission)
Confirmation that your dimension tables are still in S3

Input Example:
json{"event_id":"123","car_id":1234567,"speed":85,"rpm":3200,"gear":3}
Output Example:
json{"event_id":"123","car_id":1234567,"speed":85,"rpm":3200,"gear":3,
 "driver_id":987654321,"brand_name":"Toyota","model_name":"Corolla",
 "color_name":"Red","expected_gear":3}
